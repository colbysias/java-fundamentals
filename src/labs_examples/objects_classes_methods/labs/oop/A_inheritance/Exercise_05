Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?

Answer:
*As error text*
Parent called
Child called

because it's not specifying a specific method so it'll go through the parent class first and then to the child class.




public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
